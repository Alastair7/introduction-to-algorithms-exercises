### Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.

When productivity goes down in a team and the manager asks you to find a solution. You may know what is going on with the team and you also may know what to do. But sometimes it's harder to know and in that case you start asking teammates what's wrong. At the end of the day you understand what is happening and what you have to do.
